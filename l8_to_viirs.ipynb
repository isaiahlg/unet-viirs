        "The imprint of human activity on Earth has become unmistakable, offering a unique vantage point for population studies through the lens of space. Access to global high-resolution datasets, such as Landsat(1), has been made possible for the public through platforms like Google Earth Engine (3). These datasets open a window to observe and analyze human settlements, providing invaluable insights into the dynamics of our changing world. The image below is from Google Earth, showing the twin cities of Brazzaville and Kishasa on the banks of the Congo River. One can clearly see the densely package settlements on the banks, along with the unpopulated islands in the river.\n",

        "![brazzaville](./figs/brazzaville.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "During the night, human presence becomes even more apparent as settlements cast a faint glow into space. This nocturnal illumination is captured by the VIIRS instrument aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite. Despite its significance, the relatively weak signals limit the resolution to about 500 meters squared. This limitation poses a challenge to extracting fine-grained information about the distribution and characteristics of human settlements. The image below is of the same area as the one above, but at night. The resolution is significantly lower, with the pixels clearly visible, while the island in the river is completely dark.\n",

        "Compelling research underscores the correlation between night lights and mean household wealth, as measured by ground surveys. This correlation establishes night lights as a proxy for gauging livelihoods, making them a valuable tool for socio-economic analyses. This becomes particularly crucial in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, where traditional population surveys are sparse. The scarcity of on-the-ground data highlights the potential of night lights as a surrogate measure for understanding the economic landscapes of communities. The graph below shows the relationship between night lights and mean household wealth in Sub-Saharan Africa. The data is from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program, which conducts household surveys in developing countries. The graph shows a clear correlation between night lights and mean household wealth.\n",

        "\n",
        "The demand for higher-resolution night lights becomes evident when considering the need for detailed impact assessments. Such assessments can unravel the intricate ways in which individual communities are affected by economic development programs or global events. As technology advances, the quest for sharper and more detailed night light data gains significance, promising to enhance our understanding of human settlements and socio-economic patterns on a global scale. One example of this comes from a paper in Nature just last year that use wealth maps to assess the economic impact of access to electricity. High resolution nightlights would open up even finer grained analysis.\n",

        "Embarking on this exploration of human settlements and socio-economic patterns, I employ cutting-edge methodologies to surmount the resolution challenges posed by existing night light data. Leveraging the power of machine learning, my approach involves training a model to predict night lights from high-resolution daytime imagery. By undertaking this innovative process, I aim to transcend the limitations of the existing data and generate high-resolution nighttime imagery. This fusion of technological advancements with geospatial analysis not only promises to enrich our understanding of human settlements but also sets the stage for a more nuanced examination of the impact of economic development programs and global events on individual communities. This notebook will serve as a guide for the entire process, from method design to model training and evaluation, and finally, the results and conclusions. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/isaiahlg/csci5922/blob/main/proj/unet_regression_virrs.ipynb).\n",

        "# Methods\n",
        "Because I are trying to predict one image from another, I can leverage a Fully Convolutional Network (6) with no dense layers. This allow us to use input imagery of any resolution. The U-Net (7) architecture, named for the shape of the diagram, is the most popular FCN and is well suited to our task. The output layer is modified to perform regression instead of classification so that I get a continuous radiance value instead of segment class. Below is a diagram of U-Net from the original paper -- notice the distintive U shape.\n",

        "![unet](./figs/unet.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "With the model in place, I then need to define our training data. In this project, four different training datasets were tested: both large training regions with 1000 image patch samples from each, as well as small regions with 100 image patch samples from each. Each of these were pulled from the United States and the African continent.  For each, there were 8 unique training regions, and 2 evaluation regions. For both areas, the polygons were centered around urban areas, as these have the greatest range of values in nighttime radiance. For consistency, the evaluation areas were also urban areas. Because the target is to predict nightlights in under-surveyed areas, the evaluation sites were Abuja, Nigeria, and Nairobi, Kenya. On the left, I have the large image patches from North America, and on the right from the African. Training patches are in yellow, and evaluation regions are in blue. The aim of having different continents as inputs was to test how transferrable the results are. Do well-lit areas in the US look like well-lit areas in Africa? \n",

        "For daytime imagery inputs, I pulled 9 bands from Landsat, 7 optical bands and 2 thermal bands. I created a cloud-masked image composite to create high-quality, cloud free input. For nightlight output, I also create a median composite of the average radiance band from stray-light corrected nightlights.8 The aim is that by pairing each daytime image patch of 256 x 256 with the corresponding nighttime image patch, I can predict nighttime image patches of 128x128 when the original resolution was about 16x16. This is almost 60X improvement in resolution.  Below on the left, I have a set of example input images from Landsat in false-color. The level of detail is significant compared with the coarse nightlight image patches on the right. \n",

For the optimizer, a single experiment was run with one of the top performing models to see how it would compare. The imagery was compiled in Google Earth Engine via their Python API (9), exported to a Linux computer with a 48GB GPU. The model was built with tensorflow (10), code is available on GitHub (11).\n"

The key step is sampling the array image at points, to get all the pixels in a 256x256 neighborhood at each point.  It's worth noting that to build the training and testing data for the FCNN, you export a single TFRecord file that contains patches of pixel values in each record.  You do not need to export each training/testing patch to a different image.  Since each record potentially contains a lot of data (especially with big patches or many input bands), some manual sharding of the computation is necessary to avoid the `computed value too large` error.  Specifically, the following code takes multiple (smaller) samples within each geometry, merging the results to get a single export."

        "The top performing model was the one trained on the small polygons around African cities for 20 epochs using Stochastic Gradient Descent, achieving an RMSE of 1.504. Surprisingly, increasing the samples in the training dataset by 10X did not improve on the results. Another surprise is that the train RMSE was consistently lower than the validation RMSE. This is highly atypical, and suggests that there is an issue with the training strategy. The full table of results is below.\n",

(2) shows the training with the Adam Optimizer, showing quite unstable training. (3) shows the stable training of one of the top performing models. However, it reaches quite close to the minimum in just about 15 epochs, and does not improve from there.\n",

        "# Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "In the pursuit of enhancing the accuracy and applicability of our night light prediction model, several key observations and avenues for future exploration have emerged. One notable finding revolves around the impact of training data size on model performance. Contrary to expectations, an increase in the size of the training data did not yield the anticipated improvement. This unexpected outcome prompts a deeper investigation into the relationship between training sample size, model parameters, batch size, learning rate, and the number of epochs. Unraveling this intricate interplay could offer valuable insights and potentially establish guidelines for optimizing model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "A second area of consideration is the resolution of the imagery used in the model. Although the results did not meet initial expectations, the opportunity to explore even higher resolution imagery, such as Sentinel-2 or Google Earth base maps, remains untapped. The potential gains from employing more detailed data sources could contribute significantly to refining the accuracy of our predictions, warranting further experimentation and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another noteworthy aspect pertains to the optimal number of epochs in training the model. Observations indicate that most models plateau well before reaching 50 epochs, suggesting a potential saturation point. This phenomenon is likely intertwined with the challenges posed by the training data size. Investigating the intricate dynamics among training data, model parameters, and epoch count is essential to discerning the optimal configuration for robust performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking ahead, the goal extends beyond night light prediction alone. Once a model with satisfactory accuracy is achieved, the intention is to fine-tune it using ground surveys of household assets. This strategic refinement aims to enable a nuanced assessment of economic status through the lens of predicted night lights, reinforcing the socio-economic dimension of the research.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we chart the course for future work, a spectrum of possibilities emerges for both improving the current model's performance and exploring alternative models. Future endeavors may involve incorporating rural areas into the training and evaluation sets, exploring the impact of reducing samples per patch, and experimenting with image patch manipulations such as rotation and mirroring. Moreover, considerations extend to the redundancy in the current training data, prompting potential improvements through techniques like leave-one-out cross-validation and a closer examination of label distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking beyond incremental enhancements, future models could benefit from substituting Landsat 8 with Sentinel 2, reevaluating with Planet imagery, or exploring the application of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Additionally, the scope extends to examining wealth data rather than night lights, and investigating the influence of dataset size on model performance. These future directions collectively pave the way for a comprehensive and evolving exploration of the intersection between machine learning, satellite imagery, and socio-economic analysis."
